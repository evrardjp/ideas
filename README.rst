This repository contains the base documents for the ideas.openstack.org
website. This website is the ground of any new idea for OpenStack, crazy or not.

While ideas can be spread on the Mailing Lists, this repository is a way to
iterate on the ideas while keeping their history in an easier location than the
mailing lists. Proposal should still be exposed and/or discussed on the mailing
lists (or other media) for transparency.

Please read ``doc/source/index.rst`` for further details.
